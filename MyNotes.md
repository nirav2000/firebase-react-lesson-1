- Meetup: https://www.meetup.com/gdgcloud/events/267937802/

## Requirements ##
- VS Code Editor
- GIT: 
    - Understand GIT commands
    - how to merge a local folder with a GIT local branch
    - know terminology
    - Link GIT to VS code va SSH (why SSH not HTTPS - find a good blog)
- NPM & NodeJS

## Steps ##
- Make a local copy  / ideally branch of the code (latter better as you can see the changes made and reverse more easily amongst other things?... why GIT?)
- See Presentation of and simple overview of React Components, with 3 problems and solutions.
- Use [CreateReact App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app)? - bloated (#number of packages downloaded) but easy and quick to develop a react app
- NPM Install #to install the project.json dependencies
- NPM Start #to run a webserver with real time updates on code changes

## Q: ##
- Performance difference (or other benefits) between React function and class (as a class can do everything a function can!)
- React Hooks (Feb 2019 v16.8) - why introduced, what's the use case, whats the different mindset? https://github.com/stefanolepera/react-hooks-playground
- Render/Return JSX curly brackets {} can include any JS. Why not call a function like addNumber() rather then ?referencing addNumber? How to pass parameters across etc.
- How would you apply TypeScript to this project



## Need to learn: ##
